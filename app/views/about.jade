  #engineer
    h2 ## engineer
    p.
      i have been working as an engineer, professionally, for about 3 years.
      most of my experience has been in web development, primarily in ruby,
      javascript, and node. i have worked with most server-side and client-side
      frameworks, including rails, sinatra, express, angular, ember, and backbone.
    p.
      my current passion in engineering is working on a framework called Endpoints.
      Endpoints is a hypermedia API framework that aims to provide a convention-heavy
      paradigm for building node APIs on top of relational databases, leveraging
      Express, Knex, and Bookshelf. 
    p.
      i am a self-taught developer, and am constantly learning new skills. at the
      moment i am teaching myself reactive programming.
    p.
      in addition to my work as a web developer, i also have an academic interest
      in programming language design, particularly how specific programming paradigms
      affect the "learn/teach-ability" of the languages that implement them. i have
      given, and will be giving, several talks on this specific idea at meetups, 
      conferences, and universities all over the world.
  #educator 
    h2 ## educator
    p. 
      for nearly as long as i can remember, education has been a deep passion of mine.
      i am known to repurpose the famous Dijkstra reference about writing to say,
      "teaching is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your understanding is."
    p.
      immediately after college i became a NYC teaching fellow; i taught middle school
      science, remedial reading at the 4th grade level, and advanced "test-taking" math.
      this experience was one of the toughest in my life and taught me a great deal
      about communication, humility, organizational structures, and of course, teaching.
    p. 
      the vast majority of my career has been spent teaching beginners web development.
      in my most recent position, i expanded my audience to intermediate and advanced
      developers. i've also applied my passion for education to technical writing and
      documentation.
    p.
      long-term i'm interested in developing tools and workflows to improve the 
      maintenance, accessibility, and discovery of free educational content. in 
      particular, i would like to make a new, and/or leverage an existing, package
      manager to automate the creation and depenedency management of classes,
      particularly for the beginner web developer.
  #organizer
    h2 ## organizer
    p.
      at the intersection of education and engineering is the infamous tech community.
      despite issues and complexities, i have dedicated a large portion of my free
      time to volunteering, organizing, and speaking at user groups, meetups, hackathons,
      and conferences.
    p. 
      at these events, i primarily find myself advocating for diversity, accessibility,
      and open source participation. this has taken the form of free classes on git/Github,
      discussions of codes of conduct, evangelising STEM programs for women, or even
      just volunteering A/V support for high school hackathon presentations.
